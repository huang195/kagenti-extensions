	// upstreamHeaders are extra RESPONSE headers, applied identically by all three

	// the listeners do with it.
	upstreamHeaders map[string]string

	// splitResponseBodyAt makes the ext_proc driver deliver the response body as TWO
	// ResponseBody messages, cut at this byte offset, which is what a statically configured
	// STREAMED body mode produces. Zero means one message.
	//
	// ext_proc ONLY, deliberately: on the HTTP listeners the transport decides its own chunk
	// boundaries and nothing in a fixture can pin them. That asymmetry is the point — a chunk
	// boundary is a shape only this listener can be handed, and the last undercount found in
	// review lived exactly there.
	splitResponseBodyAt int

	// envoyAbortsResponseBody makes the ext_proc driver send ResponseHeaders with
	// end_of_stream FALSE and then no ResponseBody at all, ending the stream.
	//
	// That is not a malformed stream — it is what the SHIPPED envoy-sidecar
	// config produces for a response over Envoy's buffer limit. ext_proc asks
	// for ResponseBodyMode BUFFERED (set inline in handleResponseHeaders, the
	// response-side counterpart to the request mode requestBodyResponse
	// returns), and neither the chart's envoy-config nor the operator's
	// envoy.yaml.tmpl sets per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes or
	// per_request_buffer_limit_bytes, so Envoy's 1 MiB default applies; its docs
	// for BUFFERED say the downstream system receives an error when the body
	// exceeds it. Envoy sends the headers it had already seen, fails the stream,
	// and answers the client 500 itself.
	//
	// ext_proc ONLY, like splitResponseBodyAt, and for a stronger reason than
	// that one: proxy-sidecar mode — the laptop install and the Kubernetes
	// default alike — has no Envoy at all, so this models a filter the other
	// legs genuinely do not have. A fixture setting it is therefore comparing
	// two REAL DEPLOYMENT SHAPES of the same request, which is the divergence,
	// not an asymmetry in the harness.
	//
	// The 500 itself is not representable here and must not be faked: Envoy
	// generates it, the listener never sees it, and extproc's wire status stays 0
	// for want of a transport of its own. What this knob pins is the half the
	// listener DOES own — the session event it records with no body in hand.

	// refusedPreRunBy says the same thing PER LISTENER, keyed by the name in
	// listenerRun. Non-nil REPLACES pipelineRefusedPreRun; a missing key reads
	// as false.
	//
	// It exists because the request-body caps are not the same number on every
	// shape — 1 MiB on extproc and reverseproxy, 32 MiB on forwardproxy
	// (its maxRequestBodySize) — so a body in between is refused pre-run on
	// one leg of a fixture and runs the whole pipeline on the other. The
	// fixture-level flag cannot say that: it errors on whichever leg disagrees
	// with it, so the shape was unrepresentable and the gap untestable.
	//
	// This is a DRIVER-SHAPE hint, not a comparison weakener. assertParity
	// still compares PipelineRan pairwise, so a fixture that set this and then
	// asked for parity would fail on the very divergence it declared — which is
	// why divergence_test.go exists and this does not loosen anything here.
	//
	// A DIVERGENCE FIXTURE MUST NOT SET THIS. assertDivergence derives the map
	// from its rows' pipelineRan and rejects a fixture that also filled it in by

	//
	// Absolute rather than pairwise for the usual reason: the pairwise diff
	// cannot see a gap both legs share, and an invocation list is one of
	// the easier things for every listener to get wrong together, since all
	// of them snapshot it through the same SnapshotInvocations call. The
	// pairwise check does now compare order (invocationsEqual stopped
	// sorting), so the two are complementary — this one catches a shared
	// drop or reorder, that one catches a split.
	//
	// Order is the contract #948 is about: SnapshotInvocations walks the
	// whole slice and agentop renders one row per entry in slice order, so
	// a listener that reordered them would tell an operator a different
	// story about which gate spoke first.
	expectedInvocations []invocationSummary

	// expectedUpstream, when non-nil, pins the request AS THE UPSTREAM
	// RECEIVED IT on every listener — the bytes and the Content-Length that
	// travelled, not what the plugin believed it set. It is the only field
	// here that looks past the session event at the wire.
	//
	// This exists because a plugin-driven body rewrite reaches the upstream
	// through completely unrelated code on each shape: the proxies replace
	// Request.Body and re-stamp Content-Length in Go, while extproc emits
	// Envoy's BodyMutation proto with a content-length SetHeaders entry
	// beside it (BUFFERED + SEND leaves the length to the processor and
	// Envoy rejects a mismatch). Nothing in the session event distinguishes
	// a rewrite that landed on the wire from one that was computed, emitted
	// as a modify Invocation, and then dropped — the pipeline reports
	// success either way — so without this the suite could only have
	// compared the two listeners' accounts of their own intent.
	//
	// Non-nil ALSO switches the capture on; left nil, a fixture makes no
	// claim about upstream and the drivers record nothing. Deliberate: the
	// extproc leg is DERIVED (see extprocUpstream) and is only faithful
