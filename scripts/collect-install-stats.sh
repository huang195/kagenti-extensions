# Collect per-platform release-asset download counts into a daily time series.
#
# GitHub reports `download_count` as a LIFETIME total per asset, so a daily
# figure only exists as a difference between two snapshots. This script records
# one snapshot per run; the deltas are computed at render time (see
# docs/install-stats/index.html) rather than stored, so a backfilled or
# corrected snapshot does not leave a stale delta behind it.
#
# No retroactive history is possible: the series begins at the first run.
#
# What the numbers do and do not mean
# -----------------------------------
# Platform is NOT a usable humans-vs-CI split, and release-smoke-linux.yaml says
# so itself: it installs "exactly as a real user would (curl | sh, downloading
# from GitHub Releases)". It is deliberately indistinguishable from a Linux user
# by behaviour. Treating linux_amd64 as "CI" would therefore erase every real
# Linux user -- confidently wrong rather than merely noisy.
#
# What the smoke test IS, is countable: ONE install per successful run, as far as
# these figures are concerned.
#
# The run itself installs three times -- a fresh install of the newest stable tag,
# an upgrade to the tag under test, and a no-op re-run of it -- so it fetches more
# than one checksums.txt. But on a push to main the tag under test is main-latest,
# which is excluded from .totals below (--clobber resets its download_count on
# every push, so its counts mean "since the last push" and its contribution is
# noise that can go negative when a real --ref=main install is erased). One fetch
# therefore lands where this page counts.
#
#   CI installs per run = 1
#
# The live figures settle it rather than the reading of the workflow: v0.8.1 has 71
# checksums fetches against 51 successful runs since it published. At 2 per run, CI
# alone would be 102 -- more than the release has ever been fetched. At 1 per run,
# 51 CI + 20 people = 71, and the Linux tarballs agree independently (112 / 2 = 56
# = 51 + 5).
#
# A TAG-push run is the exception: its upgrade leg lands on a real release, so the
# people figure can run 1-2 low on a day that cut a tag. Stated in the page
# footnote rather than modelled.
#
# Only `success` counts. Of 64 runs in the first sampled window, 18 were
# `skipped` and downloaded nothing, so counting runs naively overstates CI by
# ~28%.
#
# Nothing here separates maintainers from strangers -- at a base of ~16, a few
# contributors on a few machines each could account for all of it. Label any
# rendering accordingly; see the <h1> and the caveat block in index.html.

# Per-asset counts are collapsed into per-platform sums here rather than stored
# raw: keeping every asset name would grow the file without adding signal. The
# platform is kept because it says WHERE a release is being pulled, not who by --
# it cannot separate CI from people, for the reason in the header.
#
# checksums.txt is the primary install signal, and the reason is arithmetic: the
# installer fetches TWO tarballs per install (cortex + agentop) and verifies both
# against ONE checksums file. So a platform count double-counts an install while
# checksums counts it once, and anything derived from platform counts has to be
# halved to compare with it.
#
# That 1:2 ratio is stable across every release with traffic -- v0.8.1 66:133,
# v0.8.0 10:22, v0.7.0 18:37 -- which is what makes checksums trustworthy as an
# install count rather than a coincidence. A sustained drift away from ~2.0 means
# the installer changed what it fetches, or something is pulling tarballs
# directly (v0.7.0-alpha.7 reads 3.8x, which is the latter).
#
# (An earlier version of this comment claimed checksums EQUALLED the platform sum
# on v0.8.1. That was a mid-release snapshot read as a validating identity; it is
# 1:2, not 1:1.)
