# Tests for install.sh.
#
# install.sh is a curl|sh entry point, so its failure modes are other people's
# first experience of Cortex. Until this file existed the only automated check was
# `shellcheck --severity=error`, which is why the tag-parser bug (returning the
# OLDEST release from compact JSON) shipped in #902 without a test.
#
# Approach: source a single function out of install.sh with `curl` replaced by one
# that prints a fixture. No network, no GitHub, no downloads. Plain POSIX sh
# because the repo has no bats or shunit2 and a framework is not worth it for a
# handful of functions.

# resolve it against a CDPATH entry and land somewhere else entirely.

# The regression guard proper: `ps -o comm=` may appear only in the places that want a

# deliberately and compares no path.
#
# Counting is the whole point, and the previous form of this check is why. It grepped
# for `comm=` and the binary name on ONE line and asserted zero — but the defect
# spanned two lines (the `comm=` capture in port_holder and the path comparison in
# foreign_proxy_holder), so that pattern returned 0 on the buggy commit too: the exact
# value it asserted as clean. It could not fail on the bug its own comment named, which
# is worse than no check, because the comment invited readers to trust it.
#
# Verified against the history: this count is 2 on d5f8abd3 (the commit that shipped the
# defect — port_holder's capture plus proxy_running's) and was 1 when that was fixed.
# It was 2 again for a while for an unrelated reason — pidfile_process_unnamed, for the
# pre-rename pidfile handling, read comm for the same legitimate "name, not path"
# purpose — and is 1 again now that the start path, and that helper with it, moved to
# agentop setup. That is why the assertion is a COUNT rather than a ceiling: a new
# occurrence has to be argued for and the number moved by hand, rather than appearing by
# accident. If this fails after you touched install.sh, check whether your new `comm=`
# feeds a path comparison before you edit the expected number.
#
# Comment lines are stripped first, and that is not incidental: pid_exe_path's header
# explains at length why `ps -o comm=` cannot carry a path, quoting it verbatim. Counting
# prose would make this fire on someone DOCUMENTING the hazard — the opposite of the

#         finished" if it gets that far, or "head killed" when a TERM stops it first.
#         It ignores HUP, so a HEAD left running outlives the pty's hangup at the end
#         of the run, and t_heads can see it

#   slow  take 1s first, so the download outlasts a few polls
#   hold  mark that it started, then hold until killed, and log the kill. It takes 0.3s
#         to stop, so a script that does not wait for it exits before the log says so

#   T_CURL   the stub curl's mode for an archive, above
#   T_HEAD   the stub curl's mode for a HEAD, above
#   T_SLEEP  put the stub sleep on PATH: frac (it takes fractions), or nofrac
#   T_BG     run install.sh in the background, and set T_PID instead of T_ST
#   T_PTY    run it on a pseudo-terminal, 100 columns wide, with TERM=xterm: yes; int,
#            to type a ^C once both archive downloads have marked their start and the

#   T_PIPE   run it as `curl … | sh -s --` does: the script on stdin, so $0 is "sh" and

#   T_ENV    NAME=VALUE words for install.sh's environment. NO_COLOR and
