// Replay records an event from before this process started — the session archive's, at startup —
// and reports whether it was in range. It is Record with one guard: an event whose minute is in the
// future, or not among the newest NumBuckets-1 minutes, is dropped.
//
// THE GUARD IS WHAT MAKES OLD EVENTS SAFE TO FEED. A slot is a minute modulo NumBuckets, and a
// write to a slot holding a different minute resets it (see Aggregator): an event exactly
// NumBuckets minutes old shares its slot with the current minute and would erase it. Record never
// meets one, because live events are current; a replay is made of nothing else.
//
// ONE MINUTE OF MARGIN, so a minute boundary passing between this check and Record's lock cannot
// carry an event over the edge. A check outside the lock is enough because a replay runs before any
// listener starts: nothing else writes the ring meanwhile.
//
// Feed events in ascending At order. Record pairs a request with the response after it, and
// reclaims the least recently written session ring at the cap, so that order is what makes the
// replayed ring the one the old process had.

// ReplayCopy is e reduced to what Record reads, for a caller that holds many events before
// replaying them: an archived inference event carries its whole conversation, and six hours of
// those would otherwise sit in memory at once to be sorted. A copy costs about 1KB, however long
// the conversation was.
//
// A COPY WITH THE HEAVY FIELDS CLEARED, NOT A COPY OF THE FIELDS RECORD READS, so a field Record
// starts reading later is kept without anyone remembering to add it here. What is cleared is what
// Record has no use for: the protocol payloads, the conversation, the tool manifest, the completion
// and its tool calls, and every plugin entry but the cost record. TestReplayCopy_RecordsWhatTheEventDoes
