// router acts only on requests a client already addresses to a server's host, so an agent's own
// choice is itself one of the servers — the one its client is pointed at — and its sessions there
// stay where new ones go too. Nothing this side names that server: it is the client's setting,
// and the summary carries where a session's requests went, not where they were addressed. So
// those sessions are counted with the rest. Each counted session does stay where it is; what the
// count cannot promise is that every one of them is somewhere new sessions will not be.
//
// HOW MANY WILL NOT MOVE TO THE NEW CHOICE, NOT HOW MANY MOVE. The router keeps every running
// session where it started — by its pin, or, for one quiet since routing changed, by the server
// its history records — so a switch moves none of them. A session already on server stays put
// too, but it is where new sessions go, so naming it would say nothing; one with no inference
// yet is not anywhere, and its first request goes to the new choice.
//
// RUNNING MEANS A REQUEST THIS PROXY SAW, because that is what the router pins a session by, in
// memory. A row only the archive holds has no pin, and neither has a resident one whose host is
// only its history's (InferenceHostFromHistory: resumed after a restart, no inference sent
// since) — its next request is decided as a new one's and goes to the new choice, so it does not
// stay. Neither is counted. After an eviction alone such a row's pin can survive, and leaving it
