// Package inferencerouter is the inference-router plugin: it sends a coding agent's
// new sessions to the inference server chosen for that agent, and keeps every
// session on the server it started on.
//
// The choice is plugin config — servers by name, and agents by name to a server —
// changed by editing it and letting the proxy hot-reload. Sessions are pinned in the
// process-scoped store (pctx.Shared), which a reload does not replace, so changing
// an agent's server moves only the sessions it has not started yet.
//
// Place it last in the outbound chain, which is where agentop puts it. A redirect
// moves pctx.Host, so the plugins before it decide on the host the client asked for
// and any plugin after it would see the server's host instead. Nothing should follow
// it that keys on the host.
//
// A routed request is always redirected to its server's own scheme and host, even
// when it already names that host. pctx.Host is the request's Host header, the
// client's word, and on a TLS-bridged request the forward proxy dials the CONNECT
// authority, which need not be that host. A router that skipped the redirect because
// the Host header already named the server would hand the server's key to whatever
// the client CONNECTed to. With the redirect the listener dials RedirectTarget, the
// server, whatever the Host header or the CONNECT said.
//
// The server's key replaces the client's only when pctx.Redirected() reports that the
// redirect took effect. Under on_error: observe, Redirect returns nil and moves
// nothing, so a key set on the strength of that nil would go to the host the client
// named.
//
// A session is pinned by where its first request went, not by the choice made for
// it: to the server when the request was redirected there; to "not routed" when it
// stayed where the client sent it, because the agent is not routed or because the
// router runs under on_error: observe; and not at all when the redirect failed or
// the request was refused for its model, so the session's next request decides
// again. A pin by choice would hold a session started under observe to a server it
// never used, and turning enforce on would then move it there mid-conversation,
// which is the switch the pin exists to prevent.
//
// The first request the router sees is not always a session's first. A session
// already running when routing is first configured, quiet while it was, has no pin,
// and neither has one whose pin lapsed. The session store's history tells such a
// session from a new one: on a pin miss for a routed agent, the latest earlier
// inference request that agent sent in the session to a server's host keeps the
// session on that server, and only a session with no such request is new and goes
// to its agent's current server. Without this, the documented first setup — add
// the servers, then route Claude Code — would move every conversation that sent
// nothing between the router's arrival and the route to the new server on its next
// turn. A request to any other host is no evidence: the router never routes one, so
// it says nothing about which server the session is on. Reading it as "not routed"
// would leave an agent that switches providers inside a session, as OpenCode does,
// unrouted for good once its first request went elsewhere, still sending its own
// key to the server it then addresses. Only a non-empty history is evidence: a
// view is empty for a session the store has recorded nothing of yet. After a
// restart the store holds nothing from before it, and the pins, which live in
// memory, are gone too, so a running session's next request then looks new and can
// move; so can a quiet one the store has evicted before the router pinned it.
//
// A pin is its agent's. The session id is the listener's answer, and another
// agent's request can be filed under it — by process attribution, which files a
// command an agent runs under that agent's session and is on by default on a
// laptop; by the ActiveSession fallback with client affinity off; or by a header id
// two clients share. Such a request is decided as if the session were unpinned, from
// its own agent's history and choice, and leaves the pin alone. Honouring the pin for
// it would hand it the session's server and key.
//
// The listener's synthetic sessions are never pinned: the default bucket, and the
// pending:<agent> buckets an agent's calls collect in before its session is known.
// Each holds many conversations rather than one, so a pin would hold every later
// conversation filed there to the first one's server. Their requests follow the
// agent's current server, unpinned, as a request with no session does.
//
// Claude Code keeps its own model names whichever server it talks to. A server
// that serves other names says which of its models stands for each of Claude
// Code's families — opus, sonnet and haiku, all three or none — and a request
// routed there, from any agent, is decided in this order. A name with one family
// word is sent for the server's model of that family, through
// pctx.SetRequestModel. Otherwise a name that is one of the server's own models
// goes as it is. Otherwise a Claude model name — claude-fable-5-1, say — is refused
// with a 400, never guessed: it asked for one of Claude's models, and the server
// has none for it. Any other name goes as it is, since it is the client's to choose
// and the server's to answer: OpenCode asking a GLM server for glm-4.6 is served.
// A body that names a model the rewrite cannot read — empty, not a string, or
// "model" named twice or only in another letter case — is refused with a 400 too. A
// server that names no models gets every name as it was sent, and so does a
// request whose body names no model — no body, one that is not JSON, or JSON with
// no "model" key. A refused request reached no server: it pins nothing and never
// carries the server's key. The rewrite is why the router declares
// WritesRequestBody, and why the framework's reader rule holds it after every body
// reader in the chain.
