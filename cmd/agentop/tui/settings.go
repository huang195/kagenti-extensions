// Settings is agentop's live user settings, global to the process.
//
// One struct rather than the fields it replaces (eventColumns, filter) scattered
// across the model: persisting a new setting then means adding a field here and a
// save call at the keypress that changes it, rather than finding every place the
// value is read. It is also what gets marshalled, so the file's shape and the
// in-memory shape cannot drift.
//
// Package-level because there is exactly one agentop TUI per process — bubbletea
// owns the terminal, so a second model in the same process has nowhere to render.
// Threading this through both constructors and every handler would buy testability
// the callback in RunOptions already provides.
//
// The cost is real and worth naming: tests share it, so each one that touches
// Settings must reset it (resetSettingsForTest), and t.Parallel is unavailable in
// this package. Nothing here is parallel today, and t.Setenv in the yank tests
// already forbids it independently.

	// config file, instead of starting hidden because their file predates it. And
	// the file stays legible: turn two columns off and it has two entries, not
	// thirteen.
	//
	// The alternative (a list of what is ON) reads more obviously but inverts both
	// of those, since every column is defaultOn. Note the scheme still has to

	// back, and it opened where you were.
	//
	// False is the default, and what every file written before this carries, which is
	// the behaviour agentop has always had: a session opens at the newest event and
	// follows the tail from there.
	//
	// The ENTRY point only. Once open, tail-follow is still governed by whether the
