// SeqSeeder is optionally implemented by a Recorder that keeps a session's events for longer
// than the store does — the session archive. When the store creates an entry it asks every
// SeqSeeder, under its write lock, for the last seq it holds under that id, and numbers the
// entry's events after the highest answer.
//
// Without it a session re-created under the same id — after max_sessions evicted it, a ttl
// expired it, or the proxy restarted — numbers its events from 1 again, so one session
// would carry two events numbered 1: one on disk, one in memory. A pager walking ?before=
// across that point would loop.

// memory lookup, and must not block or call back into the store.
