// Package bodycount counts the bytes a listener reads off an upstream response
// body, so every listener reports the same figure for the same response (#1309).
//
// It exists because the proxies read a response body through four different arms
// — buffered whole, re-framed as SSE, relayed chunk by chunk, or copied straight
// through — and three of those have a natural-looking number to count that is NOT
// the body: the SSE arm sees sseframe payloads with the `data: ` prefixes and
// blank-line separators already stripped, and a buffered read stops at the
// listener's cap. extproc has no such ambiguity (Envoy hands it the raw chunks),
// so counting at the one place where the raw bytes enter the proxy is what makes
// the three listeners agree. Wrap once, as early as the body is in hand, and let
// every arm downstream read through the wrapper.
package bodycount

import "io"

// Wrap returns rc with the length of every successful read added to *n. The
// pointer is a pipeline.Context field at both call sites: the arms that consume
// the body are several frames below the wrap, and the record site is above it
// again, so there is nowhere to thread a return value through.
//
// Not safe for concurrent reads, which is not a constraint in practice: a
// response body is read by the one goroutine serving its request, and that is the
// goroutine that records the row.

// Read counts what it hands back, including bytes returned alongside an error:
// io.Reader may do both, and those bytes did arrive. A body that breaks off
// mid-read therefore reports what was received before it broke rather than zero,
// which is the figure the 502 it produces is worth reading next to.
