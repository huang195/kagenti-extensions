package parity

// Divergence fixtures: the same request through both shapes of one direction,
// where the shapes are expected to answer DIFFERENTLY.
//
// Everything else in this package asserts the opposite, and that is the point
// of keeping these apart. The body-size caps are not the same number on every
// listener:
//
//	direction      extproc    reverseproxy   forwardproxy
//	request body   1 MiB      1 MiB          32 MiB
//	response body  1 MiB      1 MiB          10 MiB
//
// WHICH DEPLOYMENT SHAPE EACH LISTENER IS, because the axis is not the obvious
// one. extproc is envoy-sidecar mode. BOTH proxies are proxy-sidecar mode —
// which is the laptop install AND the Kubernetes default: the operator falls
// back to proxy-sidecar when nothing sets a mode (its AgentRuntime CRD
// documents "proxy-sidecar ... Default mode." for Spec.AuthBridgeMode), and the
// chart's authbridge-runtime-config template deliberately leaves `mode:` unset
// so that cluster default wins. So everything below is envoy-sidecar against
// proxy-sidecar, NOT laptop against Kubernetes: an agent on a default
// Kubernetes install egresses through the same forward proxy a laptop does, and
// only a workload that OPTS IN to envoy-sidecar meets extproc's caps at all.
//
// So a body between 1 MiB and 32 MiB is served in proxy-sidecar mode and
// refused in envoy-sidecar mode, and an Anthropic Claude Code session produces
// 5 MiB request bodies (the 5,250,133-byte request measured in #864) — the band
// is where real traffic lives, not a corner. Until these fixtures existed
// nothing stated which way each shape goes, so neither answer was a decision
// and either could change silently.
//
// TWO ENVOY CONFIGS, AND EVERY extproc ROW BELOW SAYS WHICH ONE IT DESCRIBES.
// The caps in that table are the LISTENER's, and in envoy-sidecar mode they are
// not the first limit a large body meets. ext_proc asks Envoy for BUFFERED
// bodies in both directions, and neither the chart's envoy-config nor the
// operator's envoy.yaml.tmpl raises per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes or
// per_request_buffer_limit_bytes — so Envoy's own 1 MiB default fires first,
// and the listener is handed no body to apply its cap to:
//
//	                   shipped (Envoy's 1 MiB default)     buffer limit raised past the body
//	request over cap   413 from Envoy; ext_proc is never   413 from the listener's own check
//	                   called and records NO row           (Process's RequestBody case)
//	response over cap  500 from Envoy; ext_proc sees       appendBoundedBody truncates to
//	                   ResponseHeaders without             1 MiB, logs a WARN, and the
//	                   end_of_stream then EOF, and         pipeline runs on the prefix
//	                   records 200 with an EMPTY body
//
// A THIRD CEILING BOUNDS THE RIGHT-HAND COLUMN ONLY, and getting that wrong is
// the obvious mistake: it sits BEHIND Envoy's buffer limit, not in front of it.
// cmd/cortex-envoy's startGRPCExtProc builds its ext_proc server with a bare
// grpc.NewServer() and passes no options, so grpc-go's 4 MiB default
// MaxRecvMsgSize applies to every ProcessingRequest Envoy sends. On the SHIPPED
// config nothing can reach it: Envoy buffers at most 1 MiB, so the message it
// sends cannot approach 4 MiB, and #864's 5 MiB request gets Envoy's own 413
// exactly as the left column says. What the gRPC limit changes is the right
// column — once Envoy's buffer limit is raised past the body, the wall moves
// from 1 MiB to 4 MiB rather than away. A body over 4 MiB is then refused by
// the gRPC transport itself: the stream dies ResourceExhausted, the listener's
// own check never runs, and Envoy answers the client an EMPTY 500. So the
// operator who raises the buffer limit for #864's measured request does not get
// the 413 this file's first fixture pins — and does not get the
// ResourceExhausted either, which only ext_proc ever sees.
//
// Which direction the body was in decides what the store is left holding, and
// the answer is not symmetric. An over-limit REQUEST leaves no row at all, the
// same shape the 413 produces and for the same reason — both refuse before a
// pipeline.Context exists. An over-limit RESPONSE books an ordinary 200 with
// the body reported as zero bytes, because by then the request phase has run
// and Process's teardown flush fires. The client got the empty 500 either way,
// so that 200 is not merely incomplete: it is a THIRD mechanism producing
// exactly the contradiction the last two fixtures below pin for Envoy's own
// refusal — the event says the call succeeded while the caller was told it
// failed — and on the outbound leg it is again a request whose spend silently
// becomes nothing.
//
// TestExtprocGRPCReceiveLimit pins all of that — both ceilings, both
// directions, and the rows each leaves behind. The fixtures below cannot,
// because the parity drivers call Server.Process directly (see mockStream) and
// there is no gRPC transport in them to have a limit. The 2 MiB bodies they use
// sit under it, which is what keeps the listener's own cap the thing being
// exercised. The "no options" claim about startGRPCExtProc is not pinned from
// this module at all — core cannot import package main — so it is pinned beside
// the call site instead, by cmd/cortex-envoy's
// TestStartGRPCExtProcKeepsDefaultRecvLimit.
//
// The first three fixtures pin the RIGHT column — the only config in which the
// listener's own cap is reachable at all, and therefore the only one that can
// pin appendBoundedBody. The fourth and fifth pin the shipped response shape,
// via envoyAbortsResponseBody, one per direction. Both columns are worth
// having, and the left one is the worse failure: the session event claims a
// clean 200 while the client got a 500, so the event contradicts what the
// caller saw rather than merely omitting something.
//
// One gap has no fixture, because only one shape can express it: on the shipped
// envoy-sidecar config an over-cap REQUEST leaves no session row anywhere,
// Envoy having refused before ext_proc was called, while the forward proxy
// records a 413 proxy_error row of its own (recordUnbufferedRequest). An
// operator comparing the shapes sees a vanished request on one and a logged
// refusal on the other.
//
// Why a sibling of assertParity rather than a tolerance inside it. #987
// suggested a fixture field that makes assertParity accept per-listener
// answers. A field like that is an escape hatch: the next fixture that fails on
// real drift can be made green by filling it in, in a harness whose own
// comments exist because it once passed having compared nothing.
// assertDivergence instead never calls observationDiff, so there is no pairwise
// check to weaken — each leg is pinned absolutely against its own declared row
// — and four guards stop it being used for anything else: every listener needs
// a row, no row may name a listener outside the set being run, the rows must
// actually disagree, and each row has to say why.

// TestDivergence_InboundResponseBodyCapOnShippedEnvoy: the same 2 MiB inbound
// response as TestDivergence_InboundResponseBodyCap, this time through the
// SHIPPED envoy-sidecar config — Envoy's 1 MiB default buffer limit left where
// the chart and the operator template leave it.
//
// This is the pair operators actually run, and the worse of the two. Envoy
// refuses the over-limit response and answers the CLIENT 500, never delivering
// the body to ext_proc: the listener is handed ResponseHeaders carrying the
// upstream's own 200 without end_of_stream, and then the stream ends. Its
// stream-end flush runs the response phase on an EMPTY buffer and records a
// 200 with no error — so the session event, /v1/usage and agentop all show a
// clean request that the caller watched fail. appendBoundedBody is never
// reached, so there is not even the WARN that the raised-limit fixtures get.
//
// The empty digest is what makes that visible rather than merely absent: the
// plugin RAN and was handed nothing. A row asserting no plugin event at all
// would also pass if the response phase had been skipped, which is the
// opposite bug — and the benign one, since a phase that never ran could not
// have recorded a misleading 200.
//
// The client's 500 is Envoy's own and is deliberately absent from these rows;
// see envoyAbortsResponseBody. What diverges here, and is pinned, is the half
// the listeners own: extproc's event says 200 with no error where the reverse
// proxy's says 502 proxy_error, even though both callers got an error.

// TestDivergence_OutboundResponseBodyCapOnShippedEnvoy is the egress twin of

// shipped envoy-sidecar config, outbound.
//
// Not a duplicate of the inbound one, for two reasons. The code is different:
// extproc's stream-end flush routes through recordResponseSession(pctx,
// "outbound") into recordOutboundResponseSession, a separate recorder from the
// inbound one, so the misleading 200 is reached by its own path and could stop
// being recorded on one side only. And the consequence is different: outbound
// is agent-to-model, so this is the direction where a response Envoy refused
// still books a healthy 200 with no tokens — a request whose cost silently
// becomes zero in /v1/usage and the ledger, where the inbound twin loses an
// answer to a caller instead.
//
// The forward proxy is the peer worth comparing against precisely because it
// has nothing to go wrong here: a 10 MiB cap, no Envoy ahead of it, and the
// whole 2 MiB handed to the plugin. The divergence is one-sided, which is the
// finding.
