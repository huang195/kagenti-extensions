// `/` SEARCHES WHAT A PANE SHOWS, ON EVERY PANE (#1339, and the report that followed it): every
// row stays on screen, the matched characters are highlighted, and the cursor jumps between
// them. It replaced a filter that hid every row it did not match, and that filter's matching
// outlived it here for a while: each searchable pane had its own matcher, written apart from
// the code that drew the pane, over a hand-kept list of fields. The events pane's read hidden
// fields and not PHASE, so `/req` marked rows for a "request" buried in a plugin's details and
// skipped the rows whose PHASE said req. Every other pane had no matcher, and so no search.
//
// So a pane no longer says what matches; it says what it draws. Tables hand the table copy
// each row's full cell values, built by the same cell functions that draw them (see
// rowBuilder), and the table matches and highlights. Text views and usage hand a searchDoc
// their lines. This file is what is common: the prompt, each target's query, where `/` was
// pressed, Esc, n and N, and the footer's count. It reaches a pane only through
// searchSurface.
//
// A search is neither saved nor shared. Each pane keeps its own, as does the help overlay
// (targetHelp). The events pane's and message detail's are about one session, so opening
// another session's drops both (see the drill-in in keys.go); message detail keeps its query
// from one message to the next, so the operator can look for one string message by message.

// targetHelp is the help overlay's search, kept beside the panes'. Outside 0..lastPaneID, as
// paneNone is, so nothing that walks the panes takes it for one.

// had where rows move under a held position. The sessions list re-sorts every second and the
// events pane evicts its oldest rows, so a bare row number would put Esc somewhere other than
// where `/` was pressed.
//
// tail is an events cursor that was following new events: on the newest row of a
// chronological table, the predicate rebuildEventsTable tail-follows on. That cursor's place
// is "the newest row" rather than the event that was newest at `/` — events keep streaming
