// RequestModel is the model the request body asks for: its top-level "model"

// SetRequestModel would refuse the body — none, not valid JSON, no top-level
// string "model", an empty one, or "model" named more than once in any letter
// case.

// itself, so the name it decides on is the name SetRequestModel replaces.

// SetRequestModel changes which model serves this request. It is the contract for
// every plugin that does — a router, a downgrader, an A/B test — and the only way
// such a plugin should do it: not by editing the body itself, and not by writing
// the inference extension, which belongs to the parser.
//
// It replaces the body's top-level "model" value in place and changes no other
// byte. A prompt cache matches an exact prefix, so re-encoding the body would cost
// the client its cache. The new body goes through SetBody, which records
// modify/body_rewritten and the framework's body-mutation event as for any
// rewrite.
//
// When the inference parser has built Extensions.Inference, Model becomes name —
// so settlement prices the model the request was sent for, and agentop shows it —
// and RequestedModel keeps the name the body carried before the first change, the
// client's. RequestedModel is cleared when a later change returns to that name. With
// no extension, none is created: the parser leaves it nil on purpose for a request
// it could not read.
//
// The framework records modify/model_rewritten with "from" and "to" in Details.
// Under on_error: observe nothing changes, the body or the extension, and both
// records are shadows, so plugin code looks the same under enforce and observe.
//
// A name equal to the current model changes nothing and records nothing.
//
// Refused, with nothing changed and nothing recorded, from a plugin that does not
// declare WritesRequestBody, outside OnRequest, and for a body RequestModel would
// not read.

// beside it rather than change it, so that body names no model to change.
